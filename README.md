# R Script for Analysis in the IJAIED Paper

The R script is for the analysis presented in the paper:

> Zhang, Y., Paquette, L., & Bosch, N. (In press). Conditional and marginal strengths of affect transitions during computer-based learning. International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education.

The `.R` file includes code for:
- Preprocessing the example dataset
- Conducting conditional and marginal transition analyses using the logistic mixed model
- Conducting prediction with 10-folds cross-validation
- Examining the influence of external factors on transitions
- Comparing the transition strength under different reference transitions
